        <div class="day-box">
            <p>
              <b>  The Bible forewarns us of an oncoming apostasy wherein all people of the
                 world will be forced to take a stand. </b> It is prophesied that there will 
                 come a global deception to be perpetrated by an AntiChrist system which 
                 in turn will control and maneuver the finances of the world through an 
                 international treaty with all of the world’s religions.
One needs to have a spiritual mind in order for him to discern the alluring
 tactics of this damnable heresy. The Bible said that this antiChrist system 
 will not be something that will go against Christianity but, <i> “it will be so 
 close to the truth that it would deceive the very elect if it were possible”  </i>
 <b> (Matt. 24:24). </b>
            </p>
            <br>
            <h2 style="text-align:left; color:black;"> LET NO MAN DECEIVE YOU </h2>
            <p>
              <b>  II Thessalonians 2:3-4 </b> warns us of this, saying, <i> “Let no man deceive you by any means:
                 for that day shall not come, except there come a falling away first and that MAN 
                 of SIN be revealed, the son of perdition; who opposeth and exalteth himself above 
                 all that is called God, or that is worshipped; so that he as God sitteth in the temple 
                 of God, shewing himself that he is God...” </i>
<br><br>
A true Christian will agree that <i> “All Scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is
 profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, (and) for instruction in 
 righteousness; that the man of God may be perfect, thoroughly furnished unto all good 
 works” </i> <b> (11 Tim. 3:16). Jesus said, </b> <i> “Search the Scriptures, for in them ye think ye have 
 eternal life: they are they which testify of Me” </i> <b> (John 5:39). </b> Let us therefore, study 
 thoroughly the scriptural foundation of this AntiChrist system, in order to trace its 
 very root and origin.
            </p>
<br>
            <h2 style="text-align:left; color:black;"> THE SPOKEN WORD IS THE ORIGINAL SEED </h2>
            <p>
                When God first set the human race on the earth, He told them to live
                 by His Word. Just to break one Word, Eve did it, plunge the whole 
                 human race into a darkness of death.
<br><br>
Satan, the serpent, beguiled her into believing his reasoning against what God 
has already told her. Eve disbelieved God even when God said: <i> “But of the fruit 
of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it, for in 
the day that thou eatest thereof, THOU SHALT SURELY DIE.” </i> <b> (Gen. 2:17). </b>
<br><br>
The serpent twisted that Word, saying <i> “Yea, hath not God said, ye shall not eat 
of every tree of the graden: And the serpent said unto the woman, Ye shall NOT 
surely die, for God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes 
shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil” </i> <b> (Genesis 3). </b>
Clearly take note that it was the <b> SERPENT who first PERVERTED the Word of God 
and MADE IT SAY SOMETHING IT DID NOT MEAN. </b> That was the very first <b> PERVERSION - 
that misconstruing of the Word. </b>
<br><br>
Jesus came in the middle of the Bible, and said that, <i> “MAN shall not live by 
bread alone, but BY EVERY WORD that proceedeth out of the mouth of God”. </i> Not 
just a part, or ninety-nine percent, but by every WORD we must live. He even 
said that, <i> “Heaven and earth shall pass away, but MY WORD shall never pass away”. </i>
In fact, <b> HE HIMSELF, IS THAT WORD. </b> For <i> “In the beginning was the Word, and the Word 
was with God, and the WORD WAS GOD, and the WORD was MADE FLESH and dwelt amongst us.” </i>
<b> God’s BIBLE, therefore, is the PRINTED FORM of the Son </b>
            </p>
            <br>

            <h2 style="text-align:left; color:black;"> ANTI-WORD MEANS ANTI-CHRIST </h2>
            <p>
                Anything that is <b> CONTRARY to the WORD is therefore, contrary to Christ, 
                for CHRIST is the WORD. </b> Any doctrine, creed, or dogma of any church, 
                that teaches contrary to what the <b> WORD teaches, is therefore, FALSE 
                TEACHING.  To be Anti-WORD is to be potentially ANTI-CHRIST. </b> Though 
                this may seem to be a crude remark, but the Scriptures say that any 
                word in the Bible that’s rejected, or any self-interpretation ADDED 
                to it, is absolutely rejecting and committing spiritual adultery against 
                God which is your Husband. For God has solemnly declared, <i> “Let every man’s 
                word be a lie, and my Word be the Truth” </i> <b> (Romans 3:3). </b>
<br><br>
And at the ending of the Bible, the same warning was reminded of us by the angel 
of God saying, <i> “Whosoever shall take one word out of this Book or ADD one word 
to it, his part will be taken from the Book of Life” </i> <b> (Revelations 22:18). </b> Thus, man is 
obligated by God to live by every Word that He has alloted to every age. This has to be 
borne in mind, for that is His absolute requirement.
<br><br>
<b> Jesus said, </b> <i> “Remember Lot’s wife” </i> <b> (Luke 17:32). </b> And Lot’s wife, <b>
     (If the Word is not that important), </b>
on a little insignificant thing as to turn and look back to Sodom, but Lot’s wife turned into a 
pillar of <b> SALT, </b> because of disobedience. God does not speak a word without Him meaning it to be so.
<br><br>
About 700 years even before Mary had the child Jesus, God had already spoken 
it through His prophet saying, <i> “Behold, a virgin shall conceive, and bear a Son, 
and shall call His Name Immanuel” </i> <b> (Isaiah 7:14). </b> And that Word came to pass because 
it was the God’s <b> WORD </b> regardless if it took almost 800 years before that Word got hold of Mary.
<br><br>
The advent of John the Baptist came in the same way. God said that 
<i> “He was the voice of one crying in the wilderness, prepare ye the way 
of the Lord!” </i> <b> (Isa. 40:3). </b> Even so, the coming of Christ was spoken 
of God in the Old Testament, saying, <i> “For unto us a Son is given, 
unto us a Child is born, and His Name shall be called Wonderful, 
Counselor, Prince of Peace, Mighty God the everlasting Father” </i>
<b> (Isa. 9:6).  Every WORD of God happened as they were SPOKEN of God. </b>
<br><br>
You see, we are without excuse, no matter how small or insignificant that WORD is, 
that same word will be fulfilled and will judge us in the day of judgment, 
whether we believed it or not. <b> James 2:10 says, </b> <i> “For whosoever shall keep 
the whole law and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of all.” 
Obedience to the WORD, therefore, is better than sacrifice”. </i>
            </p>
            <br>

            <h2 style="text-align:left; color:black;"> THE DENOMINATIONS: MAN-MADE SYSTEMS OF WORSHIP</h2>
            <p>
                Witnessing today’s alarming growth of religious sects, churches, and 
                denominations, many a-sincere individuals are quite confused as to 
                which really of these organizations embraces the whole truth of God’s 
                salvation. Nearly every denomination today claims to have the truth, 
                and that they are of God, yet each one greatly differs in doctrines 
                and principles from each other as far as basic key truth of the Scriptures is concerned.
<br><br>
People today say, <i> “Oh, you have to belong to this or that, a sect, a religion, or 
a denomination. If your name is not on our book, you are lost.” </i> This is nonsense. 
It’s a cult that says that. God never saved man on the basis of becoming a member 
of an organization, but on the basis of election through faith in the WORD. He 
<i> “Who had saved us and called us with an holy calling, <b> NOT ACCORDING TO OUR WORKS, </b>
but according to His own purpose and grace, which was given us in Christ Jesus before 
the world began” </i> <b> (11 Tim. 1:9). </b>
<br><br>
God does not call His people by an organization. He calls them as individuals - 
whether you are a Catholic, Baptist, Methodist, Protestant, or what you are. 
Before the foundation of the world, God knew you, and predestinated you - 
either to eternal life or to eternal damnation.
            </p>
            <br>

            <h2 style="text-align:left; color:black;"> SALVATION IS AN INDIVIDUAL AFFAIR WITH GOD </h2>
            <p>
                Salvation is an individual affair between every person and God. Each human 
                individual is a unit, and you will never go to heaven as a denomination 
                or as an organized church. You have to answer by yourself at the day of 
                judgment. God did not save you because you are a Catholic, Baptist, 
                Methodist, Protestant or whatever “brand” you have got “tagged” 
                on you. That doesn’t make any difference to God. But He saved you 
                on the basis of His elective Love.
<br><br>
<b> Ephesians 1:4-11 </b> says this: <i> “According as He hath CHOSEN us IN HIM before the foundation 
of the world, that we should be holy and without blame before Him in love; having 
PREDESTINATED US unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to Himself, 
according to the good pleasure of His will.” </i> <b> Romans 8:30 declares: </b> “Moreover, 
whom He did <b> PREDESTINATE, </b> them He also called: and whom He CALLED, them He also 
justified; and whom He <b> JUSTIFIED, </b> them He also <b> GLORIFIED (past tense). </b> And God 
sent Jesus Christ to redeem these people alone, and not the whole world.
            </p>
            <br>

            <h2 style="text-align:left; color:black;"> THE BIRTH OF DENOMINATIONS </h2>
            <p>
            So, have we ever asked ourselves where have all these denominations came from? 
            Do take note that the <b> DENOMINATION </b> came from the Catholic Church. She is the 
            Mother of all denominations and each denomination has come right down from her.
            <br><br>
            Authentic historical records show that the Catholic Church was the very 
            first <b> ORGANIZED </b> religion founded by Constantine of Hippo in <b> 325 A.D. in 
            Rome. </b> But history reveals that <b> TRUE CHRISTIANITY </b> never started in Rome. 
            It originated from <b> JERUSALEM on the Day of Pentecost (33 A.D.) </b> when the 
            Holy Ghost came down in tongues of Fire to indwell every true believer, 
            which wrought them power, miracles and supernatural wonders.
            <br><br>
            The <b>SECOND </b> organization, according to history, was the <b> LUTHERANS, when Martin Luther 
            protested the Catholic Church in 1517 A.D. </b> and his followers organized his teachings 
            after Luther was gone. Then after that came <b> ZWINGLI. </b> It came down through <b> CALVIN, and 
            from that came the ANGLICANS, and from the Anglicans down into the METHODISTS. Out of 
            the Methodists came the CAMPBELLITES, then came John Smith, then the CHURCH OF CHRIST. 
            Then came the BAPTIST CHURCH which had lots of pull-outs : the Southern, The Northern, 
            The Trinity, the Bible Baptist, and all the Baptist churches there is now. </b>
            <br><br>
            And out of the Methodist came also the WESLEYAN Methodist, and broke-off again 
            into the FREE METHODIST. And from that split came the NAZARENES, and from the 
            Nazarenes to the PILGRIM HOLINESS, and on down. They finally wound up to the PENTECOSTALS.
            And what did the Pentecostals do? The same thing that her Mommy did, she went back 
            into an ORGANIZED RELIGION - into the ASSEMBLIES OF GOD, The CHURCH OF GOD, the 
            APOSTOLIC ONENESS, the FOURSQUARES, and all the other charismatic splinter 
            groups. Today, there are over 3,000 denominations all over the world - ALL of 
            them organized, ALL having their OWN INTERPRETATIONS of the Bible, ALL claiming 
            originality of the Word, fussing, proselyting and debating with one another.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h2 style="text-align:left; color:black;">  ALL CANNOT BE RIGHT </h2>
            <p>
            What is it, therefore, that these denominations are based upon? It is the claim to originality, and that they are of God, and the claim that their doctrines are right. ALL CANNOT BE RIGHT; IN FACT, NOT ONE OF THEM IS RIGHT. They say they are right because they are the one saying it, but saying it does not make it so. The churches have changed to a powerless group of people whose only weapon is argument. She could produce nothing in the Spirit, for her hopes are built on programs and not on faith in the Word. Where is the power that Jesus has promised for the church in Mark 16:17,18, that says, “These SIGNS shall FOLLOW them that BELIEVE, In My Name, they shall cast out devils, they shall speak with new tongues; if they take up serpents and drink deadly things, it won’t harm them. And if they lay hands on the sick, they shall recover.” It’s not there, for there is something wrong somewhere.
            <br><br>
            The Spirit is not active in any denomination. It’s not interested in making organization, because the Spirit Itself is contrary to the organization. The organizations are looking for worldly things, the mind of the world, and they make big temples and polished things, and great polished organizations, and polished preachers, and so forth like that, and the best class in the city. How can the Spirit work in an organization when it’s denying, taking creeds instead of the Word? Membership is what matters today with the denominations. Big membership, big Sunday school classes, pay prizes for somebody can proselyte and bring somebody else from some other church over, see who’s got the most.

            <h2 style="text-align:left; color:black;">   RELIGION IS A BIG BUSINESS </h2>
            <p>
            Do you know that religion today is known as big business? It is an absolute fact that they are placing business managers in the churches to take care of finances. There are radio programs, television programs, and numerous church endeavors that are costing millions and millions of dollars. Wealth pours and pours into the church, the membership increases along with the money, yet the work is not being done as it was done when there was no money, but men rested solely on the ability given them by the Holy Ghost.
            <br><br>
            There are paid preachers, paid assistants, paid ministers of music and education, paid choirs, paid custodians, programs, and entertainment—all costing great sums, but for all that, the power is decreasing. Yes, the church is rich, but the power is not there. God moves by His Spirit, not by the amount of money or talent in the church.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h2 style="text-align:left; color:black;">   GOD IS NOT AN AUTHOR OF CONFUSION </h2>
            <p>
            Denominations are NOT of God. They have never been and never will be. Denominations have caused a separation of brotherhood through their doctrinal differences, and thus, it has been a system that God is not pleased with.
            <br><br>
            God is not the author of denomination because denomination is CONFUSION, and God is not an author of confusion. Denominations simply SOW discord among brethren, and God never recognizes anyone of them as His own. Nothing types denomination in the Scripture but the TOWER of BABEL, where God confounded them of their follies.
            They have turned away from the perfect will of God by adding their own man-made dogmas, creeds and doctrines, and let their members live by it, though they be CONTRARY to the Word of God.
            <br><br>
            Where can you find the “Vicar of Christ” in the Word? Where do you find a “Purgatory”? Where do you find a “Mass”? Where do you find “Paying money to get out of hell”? They are not in the Bible. They are man-made hybid teachings. The Bible also says that only Jesus Christ is the MEDIATOR between God and man; but here now they have made Mary as a "mediatrix". Did Mary die for us? They also say that Peter was the first "pope". That is a lie. The Bible says that Peter was married and had a wife, therefore, he can never be a "pope". Matthew 8:14 states, "And when Jesus was come into Peter's house, he saw his wife's mother laid, and sick of a fever."
            <br><br>
            THESE TEACHINGS ARE NOT IN THE WORD. The perverting spirit of the serpent has again made all denominations write their own MANUALS and teach their creeds, set up their offices and church governments, and then claim that she, and she alone, truly speaks for God, as she is best qualified, according to each and every one of them. That’s what the denominations have done. In organizing, they separate themselves from the Word (as did Eve) and bring themselves into SPIRITUAL ADULTERY. She, the church, has accepted again Satan’s wisdom instead of the pure Word of God.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h2 style="text-align:left; color:black;">   TRADITIONS, CREEDS AND DOGMAS </h2>
            <p>
            DEATH came by crossbreeding, crossbreeding God’s Word with dogmas and creed.
            <br><br>
            Jesus rebuked the Pharisees for the very same thing saying, “By your traditions, you have made the Word of God of none effect to the people” (Matt. 15:6). “But IN VAIN do they worship Me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of men” (Matt. 15:9).
            <br><br>
            Any person who is in the organized denominations is right in the midst of an AntiChrist system. Yes, that is true.
            <br><br>
            Let it be known that we are not criticizing nor calling the “people” in the denominations ‘antichrist’, but rather we are referring to the “SYSTEM of organized religion” that binds these people. It is not the people that’s wrong; but it’s those systems that they are in, that’s damning them.
            <br><br>
            Honest and sincere people are Catholics, Protestants, Jewish, and whatmore - they are human beings who are trying their best to get closer to God. (A nun doesn’t enter the convent to become a bad woman). But the system pollutes them into disbelieveing the Bible and accepting man-made dogmas instead of the Word.
            <br><br>
            Jesus was not against the people. He even died for them. But He was against those SYSTEMS that was keeping them away from Him - Phariseeism, Saduceeism, etc. This Message might disagree with your organization, but not you. God loves all people, they’re all human beings whom Christ died for. But He disagrees with that system that’s keeping you bound down by creeds and dogmas. The world was not against the German people during Hitler's reign in World War 11, but we were against Nazism. Fascism, Communism, Atheism, and all man-made systems like these which bring people away from God - that’s what we are against.
            <br><br>
            We are not asking people to “join” this church or that church - but to join yourself, by repentance and by a New Birth to Jesus Christ, the Word. There’s no church on earth that can save you. Jesus did that already for you at the Cross of Calvary.
            <br><br>
            We never heard of Jesus teaching us that the Catholic is the “Way”, nor the Protestant is the “Truth”, neither did He say that the Pentecostal is the “Life”.
            <br><br>
            You see, He said, “I am the Way, the Truth and the Life. No man can come to the Father except by Me.” We all must point people to Jesus Christ for their salvation, not to any group, man or orgnization. Dare anyone or any group take away that glory from Jesus Christ.
            <br><br>
            “Where two or three are gathered in My name, I am in the midst of them,” - that’s the minimum "member-count" that Jesus required for His presence to be felt in the church. “Two or three” (not hundreds or thousands) who are gathered in His Name can make the presence of Christ a reality in their midst.
            <br><br>
            He said, “Fear not LITTLE flock, for it’s your Father’s good pleasure to give you the kingdom.” Truly, “Strait is the gate and narrow is the way that leadeth unto life but FEW there’ll be that find it.” Christ is not a dogma or a denomination. Christ is neither in the majority, but rather in the minority. "As it was in the days of Noah (where only 8 people were saved from the flood) and as it was it the days of Sodom (wherein 3 souls were saved from the fire of God), SO SHALL IT BE IN THE COMING OF THE SON OF MAN! (Matthew 24)
            <br><br>
            Christ is the Word, the pure unleavened Word of God. Besides any teaching, therefore, let it be Catholic, Protestant, Baptist, Methodist, Adventist, Pentecostal, let it be whatever it may be, that don’t stay letter by letter with the BIBLE — is absolutely WRONG. It’s “Thus saith the Scriptures, the WORD of God.”

            <h2 style="text-align:left; color:black;">    THE NEW WORLD ORDER: GLOBAL SYSTEM OF RELIGION </h2>
            <p>
            Be wary of this: There will come a great denominational gathering pretty soon wherein ALL denominational religions of the world will have a UNION of CHURCHES, and all denominations will be forced into its membership.
            <br><br>
            In the next few years, ALL organized religion will confederate themselves into a great big ECUMENICAL COUNCIL which will decide worldwide leadership and will control the finances of the world. For the church system of the Roman Catholic Church and her Protestant daughter churches, in coming together, will force the whole world into a religious trap, or will PERSECUTE them, by refusing them the privilege of buying and selling whereby they would make a living, or unless you join their ranks and bear their MARK in your HAND or in your FOREHEAD (Revelation 13:16,17)
            <br><br>
            With the present advancement in global telecommunication systems, the internet, the non-cash technology, and the military power of the U.N., this Anti-Christ system will be able to implement their plan to control the whole world in a nutshell. They will propose some very enticing schemes seemingly of a worthy cause to promote global peace, speed-up socio-economic recovery, to counter terrorism, and to promote worldwide harmony among all nations, just to get the cooperation of the whole world.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h2 style="text-align:left; color:black;">   THE CALL FOR A FALSE UNITY </h2>
            <p>
            Apparently, when Pope John Paul-11 was still alive, he had gone to Israel in April of 2000 to meet with the Jewish Rabbis and the Muslim world asking them for reconciliation and to make ready for the great gathering and consolidation of political, religious and economic forces of the world. Today, Pope Francis is working hard for this "inevitable unity" among Catholics, Protestants, Mohammedans, and all to set up the final stage of the great apostasy. But the Scriptures say, "How can two walk together except they be agreed?" Can the Catholics give way to Protestant dogmas and vice versa? Surely, there will have to be some compromise made somewhere. They surely can agree on politics and economics, but never in the Word of God.
            <br><br>
            Many churches will be tempted to go along with this union, for they will feel better to serve God publicly within the framework of this confederation than not to serve God at all in their ritualistic traditions.
            <br><br>
            Rome has acquired nearly all the gold supplies around the world and will destroy the money system very soon to demand gold and promote the Euro currency to control the global monetary system. Once the global churches and the states are united, the Ecumenical Council will have the full support of the one world government with the United Nations backing it up with military forces to set the final stage of fulfilling their massive plot and to pass their edicts into laws. Once terrorism in the whole world becomes uncontrollable (the Al-Queda), the U.N. and the Ecumenical Council will put the whole world under Martial Rule.
            <br><br>
            And you - all of us, personally, will have to face this oncoming reality, for every one will have to make a choice. It will be a UNION and a BOYCOTT, and all churches that do not belong to the World Council of Churches will have to be CLOSED DOWN and their right to preach forfeited, unless they belong to the big organization. Persecution and tortures, just like in the Dark Ages (The Un-Holy Inquisition), will begin to be implemented to chase down the Foolish Virgins who were left behind and were not able to make it to the rapture. It will also be a time of purging for the 144,000 elected Jews who will defy this Global System of Religion to stay pure and chaste in the Word of God to be restored to them by Moses and Elijah as prophesied in Revelation Chapter 11.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h2 style="text-align:left; color:black;">  THE MARK OF THE BEAST </h2>
            <p>
            But remember, this confederation and world unity will be the "MARK OF THE BEAST", as spoken of in the Bible - Revelations 13:16-17. “And he causeth all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and bond, to receive a MARK in their right hand, or in their foreheads; and that no man might buy and sell, save he that had the MARK, or the name of the BEAST, or the NUMBER of his NAME."
            <br><br>
            It will be the greatest deception the devil has ever poked on God’s people. ALL denominations will unknowingly ENTHRONE the ANTICHRIST that’s foretold in the Bible.
            <br><br>
            It will be SATAN himself incarnate in a human being called the BEAST that will lead this confederation so that all the world will worship him under the guise of united Christianity (Read II Thessalonians 2:3-4).
            <br><br>
            Notice that it was Lucifer’s ambition to be worshipped like God in the beginning, and to build a greater kingdom than that of Michael, that was why he was kicked out of heaven. But now, he will be fulfilling his greatest desire on earth amongst God’s fallen people - the denominationals.
            <br><br>
            Revelations 13:8-9 speaks of this plot saying, “And all that dwell upon the earth shall worship him, whose names are NOT written in the Book of Life of the Lamb slain before the foundation of the world. If any man have ear, let him hear” . You see, it’s a coming, friends, and this is no joke.
            <br><br>
            But here in Revelations 14:9-10 we read the penalty and punishment of those who will join this false unity: “If any man worship the BEAST ( the “power” of Papal Roman Empire) and the IMAGE (the Ecumenical Movement of the Protestant Churches), and receive his MARK in his forehead or in his hand, the same shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is poured out without mixture into the cup of indignation; and he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels, and in the presence of the Lamb.”
            <br><br>
            We are nearing the end, friends. We see these signposts in the world today and she’s ready for God’s judgment.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h2 style="text-align:left; color:black;">  THE WHEAT AND THE TARES </h2>
            <p>
            In Matthew 13:30, it says, ”Let both grow together until the harvest: and in the time of harvest I will say to the reapers, Gather ye together first the tares, and bind them in bundles to burn them: but gather the wheat into my barn.”
            <br><br>
            This scripture pertains to the "calling out" today of all true Christians (the Wheat) out of Babylonian confusion to preparing them for the Rapture (the Harvest), while the denominational churches (the Tares) are being bundled right now in the World Council of Churches for the burning (The Armageddon war).
            <br><br>
            Before Jesus returns, there must be a uniting of all the religious organizations which will make a profession but alter portions of God’s Word to fit their creeds and dogmas. At the same time Jesus will separate His Own children by severing them from these denominations through faith in His pure Word (Revelation 18:4.) The ecumenical and charismatic movements today are a direct fulfillment of this alarming prophecy - the "bundling of the tares" for the burning.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h2 style="text-align:left; color:black;">   A MESSAGE TO GOD’S ELECT </h2>
            <p>
            But to the ELECT, God is calling. A MESSAGE is being sent out today, “COME OUT OF HER, MY PEOPLE, that ye be not partakers of her sins, and that ye receive not of her plagues!” (Rev. 18:4).
            <br><br>
            God is calling for His virtuous Bride, the Word-Born Seed. Who are these people? They’re INDIVIDUALS. They are those of whom it speaks in Ephesians 5:14, “Awake thou that SLEEPEST, and ARISE FROM THE DEAD, and Christ shall give thee Light.” These are those sleeping among the dead, dead out there in those dead denominations and are floating with them. God cries out, WAKE UP AND REPENT OF YOUR FOLLY!” There they are lending their influence, giving their time and their very lives to these AntiChrist organizations and all the while thinking it is all right. THEY NEED TO REPENT AND TURN TO THE TRUTH!
            <br><br>
            The cry of every age is the rebuke: “You have LEFT the Word of God. Repent and come back to the Word!” From the first book of the Bible to the Last Book, there is only ONE reason for God’s displeasure - LEAVING THE WORD; and there is only ONE remedy to regain back His favor - BACK TO THE WORD.
            <br><br>
            Listen to God’s vindicated prophet of this age and be enlightened with truth in order for you to be able to escape God’s pending wrath that is to be poured out upon this earth during the Tribulation Period. It’s later that you think.
