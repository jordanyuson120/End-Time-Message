        <h1>MYSTERY BABYLON, <span style="color:red">MOTHER OF HARLOTS  </span></h1>

        <!-- Abraham and Keturah -->
        <div class="day-box">

            <p>
               <b> In Revelation the 17th and 18th chapters </b> we are given one of the most 
                foreboding and ominous warnings contained in the whole scripture. Herein, 
                we find identified a great WOMAN which is called the <i> “Great Whore, Mystery 
                Babylon, and the Mother of Harlots”. </i>
She is also identified as the Mother of all the abominations of the earth. She stands 
above all others as a direct enemy to Jesus Christ. Her own seductive spell has swept 
the whole earth, from the kings to the inhabitants in it.
<br><br>
She is Satan’s queen <b> (In Revelation 18:7, she says </b> <i> “I sit as a queen and 
am no widow” </i>). So alluring and cunning are her enchantments that <b> Revelation 17:8  </b>
tells us that the only ones who will not wonder but know her for what she is will 
be those whose names are written in the Lamb’s Book of Life from the foundation of 
the world. All the world will eventually bow down and become a part of her and her daughter system.
            </p>
<br>
            <h2 style="text-align:left; color:black;">WHO IS THIS TREACHEROUS WOMAN?</h2>
            <p>
                Below we have listed some verses out of <b> Revelation 17 </b> which 
                will enable the reader to identify the <b> CLUES </b> provided by God 
                to show who this <b> WOMAN </b> is.
<br><br>
The fact that we are dealing with a <b> WOMAN </b> who according to <b> Revelation 13 </b> desires 
to be worshipped reveals that it will be a <b> RELIGIOUS SYSTEM. </b>
<br><br>
The Church is typed in the Bible as a virgin, a WOMAN prepared as a Bride for 
Christ, for Christ is supposed to be our Bridegroom. But this woman we’re 
dealing with here is not a virgin, but a whore or a prostitute and is also a mother of harlots.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h2 style="text-align:left; color:black;">In Revelation 17:1-6, 9,15,18, we read THE CLUES:</h2>
            <p>
                1 - And there came one of the seven angels which had the seven vials, 
                and talked with me, saying unto me, Come hither; I will shew unto 
                thee the judgment of the great <b> WHORE that sitteth upon many waters: </b>
<br><br>
2 - With whom the <b> kings of the earth have committed fornication, </b> and the 
inhabitants of the earth <b> have been made drunk with the wine of her fornication. </b>
<br><br>
3 - So he carried me away in the spirit into the wilderness: and I saw a 
<b> WOMAN sit upon a scarlet coloured beast, full of names of blasphemy, 
having seven heads and ten horns. </b>
<br><br>
4 - And the <b> WOMAN was arrayed in purple and scarlet colour, and decked 
with gold and precious stones and pearls, having a golden cup in her 
hand full of abominations and filthiness of her fornication: </b>
<br><br>
5 - And upon her forehead was a name written, <b> MYSTERY, BABYLON THE GREAT, 
THE MOTHER OF HARLOTS AND ABOMINATIONS OF THE EARTH. </b>
<br><br>
6 - And I saw the <b> WOMAN drunken with the blood of the saints, and with 
the blood of the martyrs of Jesus: </b> and when I saw her, I wondered with great admiration.
<br><br>
9 - And here is the MIND which hath wisdom. The <b> seven heads are seven 
mountains, on which the WOMAN sitteth. </b>
<br><br>
15 - And he saith unto me, <b> The WATERS which thou sawest, where the WHORE 
sitteth, are peoples, and multitudes, and nations, and tongues. </b>
<br><br>
18 - And the <b> WOMAN which thou sawest is that GREAT CITY, </b> which 
reigneth over the kings of the earth.
<br><br>
<b> Now, let’s accumulate the CLUES listed in the above Scriptures 
and ask ourselves a question: </b>
            </p>
            <br>
            <h2 style="text-align:left; color:black;">WHICH RELIGIOUS SYSTEM---</h2>
            <p><b>
                a. Controls multitudes, nations and tongues?
                <br>
b. Has seduced kings and inhabitants of the earth?
<br>
c. Is arrayed in purple and scarlet?
<br>
d. Is decked with silver and gold?,
<br>
e. Is drunk with the blood of the martyrs of Jesus?
<br>
f. Sits upon seven mountains?
<br>
g. Is a great city reigning over kings?
<br>
</b>
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Unless the reader is willfully ignorant it becomes obvious 
                that the religious system herein described has to be the great 
                <b> CHURCH of ROME; </b> the so-called <i> “eternal city of seven hills”. </i>
<br><br>
Let’s see further how <b> The Vatican in Rome today resembles this Mystery Babylon. </b>
<br><br>
a. Rome controls multitudes, nations and tongues.
No other authority on earth has ever interacted with the world and it’s 
political systems more than the Vatican. The International Monetary Fund 
and the World Bank in itself is owned and controlled by the Vatican.
<br><br>
b. Rome has seduced kings and inhabitants of the earth.
None other than <b> the Vatican is involved in the ecumenical movement 
of compromise known today as religious tolerance and unity. </b> 
The world has seen <b> Pope John Paul-11 going to Israel in year 2000, 
meeting with Arafat, and even fellowshipping with communist leaders for world unity. </b>
<br><br>
Today the call is for <i> “humanity” </i> and not for Christ. The call is for 
<i> “Unity” </i> and not separation from other world’s religions. The Catholic 
Church has even declared that Islam is an Abrahamic faith and Muslims 
are our brothers. Today the Catholic Church is seen as a friend to Islam. 
The Pope was even seen kissing the Quran for the whole world to witness.
<br><br>
c.d. The Vatican is arrayed in purple and scarlet, and is decked with silver and gold.
Who else but the cardinals and the archbishops of the Catholic Church 
dress-up in purple and scarlet, the colors of so-called <i> “royalty”. </i>
The golden cup is exactly what the Pope uses in the celebration of the <i> “mass”. </i>
<br><br>
e. Rome Is drunk with the blood of the martyrs of Jesus.
As recorded in history, from the time of <b> St. Augustine in 300 AD 
until AD 1850, 68 million Protestants have been killed by the Roman 
Catholic Church just because of disagreeing with their doctrine. </b>
<br><br>
<b> The Great Massacre of Ireland was one of the worst mass murders done by 
the Roman Church ever recorded in history. Millions of Christians were 
burnt at stake, fed to the lions, and tortured to death by the Catholic 
Church, which included Joan of Arc and St. Patrick - a </b> <i> “cup of abominations”  </i>
indeed that deserves the Biblical verses mentioned in <b> Revelation 17:6 </b> <i> “drunken 
of the blood of the saints and the martyrs of Jesus”. </i>
<br><br>
Don’t be confused to start thinking that the Church of Rome has repented of 
her slaughter of the saints because she is attempting to unite with the 
Protestants today by making her creeds line-up with Protestant creeds. 
Not once has she ever apologized of her murders. No matter how sweet 
and mellow she appears at this particular time, she will yet rise up to 
kill, for murder lies in her evil and unrepentant heart. Just wait when 
the One World religion takes place. Those who will not bow down to the 
Pope will be persecuted, tortured, and killed again.
            </p>
            <img src="images/inquisition.jpg" alt="">
            <p>
              <b>  f. Rome sits upon seven mountains. </b>
              <br>
Rome is popularly known to the world as the <i> “City of Seven Hills”. </i> Yes, Rome 
sits upon literal seven hills. In fact, Rome is an autonomous nation within 
the nation of Italy and it is being ruled by the Pope as its sovereign president and head of state.
<br><br>
<b> g. Rome Is a great city reigning over kings. </b>
<br><br>
This <b> WOMAN </b> <i> “Mystery Babylon” </i> is none other than the Catholic 
Church. <i> “Mystery” simply means it is “hidden” </i> <b> (subtle); </b> <i> “her 
deception is veiled to the world” </i> but yet for a while.
<br><br>
Today, Rome appeals to all nations and religions due 
to her (false) doctrine of <i> “unity”. </i>
<br><br>
The Ecumenical Council, which is the <i> "image" </i> patterned after 
the system of Rome, is none other than the <i> “Image” </i> erected 
unto the Beast. A <i> “Beast” means a “power” </i> and it is the power of 
the Catholic Church. While an <i> “Image” </i> is something like it, which 
is nothing but the Confederation of Protestant Churches.
<br><br>
The whole system of <i> “Beast” and “Image of the Beast” </i> is an exact 
type of the force unity of the <b> Tower of Babel </b> in the Old Testament. 
The Tower of Babel was a religious worship of various races but not 
considered in the Word of God. Because it was by Nimrod, a wicked 
man who forced all the little countries to come into one place to 
erect such man-made tower.
<br><br>
Remember, that it was Imperial Pagan Rome that fell by the sword. 
But she was healed of her death stroke when she joined to the nominal 
Christian church of Rome and incorporated paganism and Christianity, 
and thereby became the Holy Roman Empire which was to endure until Jesus came and destroys her.
<br><br>
<b> REVELATION 18:2-10 speaks of her destruction: </b> <i> “And he cried mightily 
with a strong voice, saying, Babylon the great is fallen, is fallen, 
and is become the habitation of devils, and the hold of every foul 
spirit, and a cage of every unclean and hateful bird. For all nations 
have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her fornication, and the kings 
of the earth have committed fornication with her, and the merchants of 
the earth are waxed rich through the abundance of her delicacies.
And I heard another voice from heaven, saying, Come out of her, my people, 
that ye be not partakers of her sins, and that ye receive not of her plagues... 
How much she hath glorified herself, and lived deliciously, so much torment and 
sorrow give her: for she saith in her heart, I sit a queen, and am no widow, 
and shall see no sorrow. Therefore shall her plagues come in one day, death, 
and mourning, and famine; and she shall be utterly burned with fire: for strong 
[is] the Lord God who judgeth her. And the kings of the earth, who have committed 
fornication and lived deliciously with her, shall bewail her, and lament for her, 
when they shall see the smoke of her burning, Standing afar off for the fear 
of her torment, saying, Alas, alas, that great city Babylon, that mighty city! 
for in one hour is thy judgment come.” </i>
            </p>
            <br>
            <h2 style="text-align:left; color:black;">ROME IS NOT DOING IT ALONE</h2>
            <p>
                Yet Rome is not doing it alone. Her daughters are right with 
                her and she will take over absolute authority by the World 
                Council of Churches.
<br><br>
This may seem far fetched to some but actually it is very plain 
for all to see because right now the churches are controlling 
politics and at the opportune time will manifest exactly how 
great is that control.
This ecumenical move will end up with Rome at the head even 
though the people did not envision it that way.
<br><br>
This is so because in <b> Revelation 17:3-6 </b> it states that the whore, 
Mystery Babylon is seated on the beast. She is controlling the last, 
or fourth empire. This Roman Church is doing that. With the world 
church system under her, Rome will be controlling, and this image 
<b> (church system) </b> will be obedient to Rome because Rome controls the gold 
of the world. Thus all the people have to belong to the world church 
system or be at the mercy of the elements for they cannot buy or sell 
without the <b> MARK of the beast in the hand or head. </b>
<br><br>
This <i> “mark in the head” </i> means that they will have to take the 
doctrine of the world church system which is <i> “trinitarianism”,  </i>
etc.. And the <i> “mark in the hand” </i> which means to do and follow 
or implement the will of the world church.
<br><br>
With this great power the church systems will persecute the true 
Bride of Christ. This image will try to keep the Bride from preaching 
and teaching. Her ministers will be forbidden to give comfort and truth to 
the people who need it. But before the antichrist (in person) takes over 
this complete world system of churches, the true church will be taken away 
from this world to be with the Lord. God will catch away His bride for the 
great Marriage Supper of the Lamb in the rapture.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h2 style="text-align:left; color:black;">A MOTHER WITH HARLOT DAUGHTERS</h2>
            <b><p>(Revelation 17:15)</p></b>
            <br>
            <p>
                If the Mother is an illegitimate church, so also will be 
                the Daughters. She was pretending to be a Christian church, 
                but was giving out man-made dogmas and creeds. A scant study 
                of all Protestant denominations will reveal that they actually 
                came from the womb of Rome.
<br><br>
When Martin Luther was inspired by God to spawn the reformation it was a 
true revival. However, when Luther left the scene, the followers of Luther 
instead of being led by the Holy Spirit into further light denominated on 
Luther’s message and gave birth to another organization. In such a way, 
the first daughter was born and in the same manner every successive daughter 
came about the same way, all the way from the Baptists to the Methodists, 
to the Adventists, to the Pentecostals, and all.
<br><br>
Each church mixed their creed with God’s Word and like the mother strayed 
from God’s direct leadership to become a dead illegitimate organization 
because of their hybrid teaching. By the time of the Lord’s return, 
Rome and her adulterous daughters are seen to have formed into a vast 
system able to control politics, religion and commerce - a one world 
government system and a one-world religion, which is currently now being 
intensified under the leadership Pope Benedict XV1 with the cooperation 
of the member-Protestant churches of the World Council of Churches. From 
such the true ‘Bride of Jesus Christ will have to separate and heed the 
call of <b> Revelation 18:4. </b> <i> “Come out of her my people and be not partakers 
of her sins, and that ye receive not of her plagues.” </i>
            </p>
            <br>
            <h2 style="text-align:left; color:black;">ARE YOU PART OF THE BODY OF CHRIST OR PART OF THE SYSTEM?</h2>
            <p>
                If your faith is founded entirely on the Word of God, 
                you are part of God. As <b> Matthew 4:4 states, </b>
              <i>  “Man shall not live by bread alone, but by <b> every 
                WORD </b> that proceedeth out of the mouth of God.” </i>

            <h2 style="text-align:left; color:black;">    AND WHAT IS THE SYSTEM? </h2>
            <p>
              <b>  INSCRIBED IN THE VATICAN THRONE ARE THE LATIN WORDS 
                <i> “VICARIVS FILII DEI” </i> WHICH when translated MEANS 
              <i>  “Instead Of The Son Of God” </i> or <i> “In replacement of the Son of God”. </i>  </b>
<br><br>
It becomes even more enlightening when one understands the numerical 
value of this blasphemous title. The value of these <b> Roman numerals </b> in 
<b> this TITLE totals to 666! </b> It is on this throne that the Anti-Christ 
will one day reveal himself.
            </p>

            <p>
                666 then is the number of Rome and as such is the number of 
                any system headed up by Rome.
<br><br>
Imagine such blasphemy of a man, whether he be a priest or pope, to 
claim to stand before the people <i> “instead of the Son of God.”  </i>
The second chapter of II Thessalonians describes him well:
<br><br>
<b> II Thess. 2:4. </b> <i> “Who opposeth and exalteth himself above all that is called God, 
or that is worshipped; so that he as God sitteth in the temple of God, 
shewing himself that he is God. “ </i>
<br><br>
We can now see that this man of sin is truly exposed in <b> Revelation 13:16-18.  </b>
<i> “And he causeth all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and bond, 
to receive a MARK in their right hand, or in their foreheads: And that 
no man might buy or, sell, save he that had the mark, or the name of 
the beast, or the number of his name. Here is wisdom. Let him that 
hath understanding count the number of the beast, for it is the number 
of a man; and his number is Six hundred, threescore and six.” </i>
<br><br>
Let us not be blind. It is-not by-chance that the major religious 
movements of today are leaning more and more to Catholicism. It is not 
by chance that the charismatic movement is becoming an adhesive to 
cement together Catholicism, Pentecostalism, and liberal Protestantism. 
It is not by chance that the Anglican church is trying to amalgamate with 
the Roman Catholic Church. Nor is it by chance that we have World Council 
of Churches with their one-world church thrust.
Though it is all very spiritual and much activity is taking place, 
remember the scriptures speak of two churches, one very large and 
illustrious and one very small and humble.
<br><br>
Don’t be fooled for there is no such thing as “unity and being one” 
as far as God is concerned unless it is unity around the Word of God.
In this hodge-podge, Catholics are still Catholics and all other 
respective churches hold to their own creeds with equal tenacity. 
“How can two walk together except they be agreed?”
<br><br>
There is little regard for basic scriptural fundamentals in this 
gatherings such as holiness, place of women, correct water baptism, 
error of infant baptism, and many others. In this mock revival the 
one dispensable element is the Bible itself.
<br><br>
Scripture nowhere points to a vast end-time revival nor does it 
teach that the Living Saints at the time of his second coming will be 
of any great number. <b> Luke 18:8 STATES, </b><i> ” When the Son of Man cometh, 
shall he find faith on “the earth?” </i>
<br><br>
Just as in Noah’s day <b> (Luke 17:26) </b> God will speak to the Laodicean 
Church and will call out individuals by his prophet to join Christ, 
(THE WORD) on the outside of the church. <b> Rev. 3:20 says - </b> <i> “Behold, 
I stand at the door, and knock: if any MAN hear my voice, and open 
the door, I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with Me. 
“ </i> That faithful minority will represent His lovely but tiny end-time <b> BRIDE </b> today.
